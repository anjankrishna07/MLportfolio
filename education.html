            I didn’t jump straight into machine learning. I started out in <strong>electronics and communication</strong>,
            slowly got pulled into computer vision and deep learning, and eventually decided to study
            <strong>data science</strong> more seriously. This page is the story behind that path.

                My time at Buffalo was where machine learning stopped being “a cool thing I tinker with” and became a
                framework for how I think about problems. Coming in with an electronics background, I suddenly found
                myself surrounded by probability theory, statistical learning, optimization, and a lot of assignments
                that forced me to dive deeper than just using libraries. Courses in machine learning, data mining, and
                large-scale data systems pushed me to understand why models behaved the way they did instead of just
                memorizing which one “works better” on a benchmark. I spent a lot of evenings in labs and coffee shops
                bouncing between Jupyter notebooks and research papers, trying to connect the math in lectures with the
                messy datasets I was experimenting on. Group projects were a big part of the experience too — working
                with classmates who had very different backgrounds meant learning how to explain ideas clearly, defend
                design choices, and sometimes admit when a simpler approach was actually the right one. By the time I
                graduated, I felt less like someone who “uses ML models” and more like someone who can reason about
                trade-offs across modeling, data, and deployment, which shaped the kind of work I do now.

                SRM University AP is where everything really started. I enrolled in electronics and communication
                engineering because I liked the idea of understanding how systems work end-to-end: from signals and
                circuits all the way up to communication networks. In the beginning, most of my time was spent on core
                ECE subjects — signal processing, digital logic, control systems — and learning how to think in terms
                of constraints, noise, and trade-offs. Somewhere along the way, courses and small projects involving
                image processing and pattern recognition caught my attention, and I realized I was spending more time
                playing with Python and open-source frameworks than on anything else. That curiosity slowly turned into
                proper research work, like our pneumonia detection project using chest X-rays, where I got my first real
                taste of training models, handling imperfect data, and writing a paper. Looking back, my undergrad years
                were less about specializing early and more about building a foundation: understanding how hardware,
                signals, and software all connect, and discovering that I enjoyed the parts where math, code, and real
                data all meet.

            <p>
              I learn best when there’s a mix of theory, code, and something slightly broken that I have to fix.
              That’s true whether it’s an algorithms class, a deep learning course, or a random arXiv paper I’m
              trying to reproduce.

            <ul style="margin:4px 0 0;padding-left:16px;">
              <li>I try to connect new ideas to projects as quickly as possible.</li>
              <li>I keep a lot of small notebooks and experiments instead of one “perfect” project.</li>
              <li>If I can’t explain a topic simply, I treat that as a sign I need to revisit it.</li>
              <li>I like learning in public — sharing mistakes and small wins with others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;">
              Both degrees taught me different things: SRM gave me a systems and hardware mindset; Buffalo gave me the
              tools to analyze, model, and reason about data. Together, they shaped how I think about building ML
              systems in the real world.
