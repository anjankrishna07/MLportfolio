            Below are a few of those stories.

              <div class="exp-company">Building an Enterprise Knowledge Assistant & visual search systems</div>
              <div class="exp-body">
                At Chayntech, I’ve spent most of my time building things that didn’t fully exist yet—at least not in a
                usable form. When I first joined, the idea of an “Enterprise Knowledge Assistant” was more of a hope
                than a product. Teams were drowning in internal PDFs, support tickets, logs, and documents, and the
                tools they had either hallucinated or returned random results. So I started by trying to understand how
                people actually searched for information, and that led me into designing an end-to-end RAG pipeline
                from scratch—everything from hybrid structural + semantic chunking, embedding generation, and FAISS
                retrieval tuning, to fine-tuning Llama-style models with domain-specific terminology to reduce
                hallucinations. The more I worked on it, the clearer it became that people didn’t just want answers;
                they wanted something that could think with them. That’s when I introduced an agentic reasoning layer
                using tools like LangChain and CrewAI, which let the assistant break tasks down, compare documents,
                synthesize information, and automate small workflows. Deploying it meant learning how to scale things
                properly—containerizing GPU services, orchestrating them in the cloud, monitoring drift, and setting
                guardrails so nothing quietly fell apart in the background. At one point the whole system started
                returning irrelevant results right before a demo, and after some long nights debugging embedding drift
                and reranking failures, I rebuilt the index pipeline with stricter versioning and drift detection so it
                wouldn’t happen again. Not everything was about firefighting, though. When working on our multimodal
                visual search system, I found myself mediating between teams who couldn’t agree on metadata strictness
                versus experimentation speed, and walking them through how those choices affected our embedding space
                helped us settle on a hybrid approach that everyone could live with. Another crunch moment came right
                before a major traffic spike, when our visual search stack struggled under load and I had to rework GPU
                batching and indexing so the system stayed responsive under pressure. Some of my favorite moments,
                though, were quieter—like mentoring a junior teammate through FAISS and embeddings until they felt
                confident enough to own parts of the pipeline themselves. Looking back, my experience at Chayntech has
                been less about ticking boxes on a job description and more about learning how to bring clarity into
                ambiguity, stay calm when things go sideways, and build systems that actually help people do their work.

              <div class="exp-body">
                During my time at SRM University, my most memorable project started with a simple observation:
                pneumonia diagnosis often depends on radiologists manually inspecting X-ray images, and even
                experienced clinicians can disagree when cases get subtle. That curiosity turned into a research
                project where I worked with a small team to see if deep learning could help flag obvious cases so
                doctors could focus on the harder ones. We didn’t have huge compute or unlimited data, so we collected
                and cleaned a public chest X-ray dataset and experimented with different transfer-learning setups using
                models like VGG-16, VGG-19, and Inception-ResNet V2. A big chunk of my time went into surprisingly
                unglamorous work—resizing images, handling inconsistent formats, building augmentation pipelines, and
                making sure the train/validation splits weren’t leaking information. Over time, things started to
                stabilize: VGG-19 consistently came out ahead, and we were able to reach strong accuracy and precision
                on pneumonia detection without overfitting. There was no “magic moment” where everything just worked; it
                was more like a long sequence of tweaks, failed runs, and small improvements. What made the project feel
                real wasn’t just the paper we wrote, but a simple web app we built where someone could upload an X-ray
                and get a model prediction, with a rule that anything below a confidence threshold would explicitly
                recommend seeing a doctor instead of pretending to be sure. That project is where machine learning
                stopped feeling like just an academic topic for me and started feeling like a tool I could actually use
                to solve problems—messy data, imperfect models, uncertainty and all.

            <div class="side-title">How I like to work</div>
            <p>
              I’m happiest when I’m working somewhere in the space between “this is a vague idea” and
              “this is a real system people can rely on.” I enjoy projects that force me to understand the problem
              from the user’s point of view, not just the model’s point of view, and I like breaking work down into
              small experiments rather than big, fragile plans.
            </p>
            <ul style="margin:4px 0 0;padding-left:16px;">
              <li>I care a lot about clear problem statements before fancy architectures.</li>
              <li>I like writing things down—assumptions, weird edge cases, failed ideas.</li>
              <li>I try to keep feedback loops short so mistakes surface early.</li>
              <li>I’m comfortable saying “I don’t know yet” and then going to find out.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;">
              Whether it’s ML systems, data pipelines, or experiments that might fail, I try to keep the process honest:
              understand what’s actually happening, fix what’s broken, and keep things simple enough that future-me
              won’t hate current-me.

            <div class="side-title">Outside of work</div>
            <p>
              Outside of ML work, I’m a bit of a fitness geek. I enjoy training people, helping friends build
              sustainable workout routines, and experimenting with my own programming and nutrition. Weekdays, you’ll
              usually find me skimming through new papers on arXiv and bookmarking ideas that seem interesting; on
              weekends, I like trying to reproduce results or run small experiments to see how things behave in
              practice. It’s half curiosity, half a way to keep myself honest about what I actually understand.
