      "content": "People often treat MLOps as “just wiring things together”, but that’s exactly the part I enjoy.\n\nI like:\n• taking a messy notebook and turning it into a repeatable pipeline,\n• making sure metrics don’t silently drift,\n• and giving models enough logging so future-me can actually debug.\n\nGood MLOps feels like being a translator between research and production: you speak both."

      "content": "Some small rules I try to follow when building training code:\n\n1. Always log data shapes and a couple of example batches.\n2. Keep config in one place (YAML or JSON), not scattered across scripts.\n3. Save the exact commit hash + hyperparams with every trained model.\n4. Treat data preprocessing as a versioned, testable component.\n\nNone of these are fancy, but they compound over time."
