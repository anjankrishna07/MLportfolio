                I worked on a simple but meaningful project where the goal was to classify chest X-ray images as
                “pneumonia” or “normal.” Instead of training a model from scratch, I used VGG-19 as a starting point
                and adapted it through transfer learning. Most of the time went into cleaning the dataset, resizing and
                normalizing images, and making sure the train/validation split wasn’t leaking information. I also tried
                basic augmentations to help the model generalize better on a relatively small dataset. The focus wasn’t
                on building a state-of-the-art medical model, but on learning how CNNs behave on real data.

              <div class="project-desc">
                This project came from my curiosity about how transformers handle messy text from real users. I used a
                BERT-based model to classify comments into multiple toxicity labels. A lot of the work was on the
                data side: cleaning the text, dealing with class imbalance, and deciding which preprocessing steps were
                actually helpful. I experimented with different learning rates and batch sizes during fine-tuning and
                used Hugging Face tools to keep the training process manageable. I then built a small Streamlit app
                where you can type a comment and see what the model thinks. It’s not a production system, but it gave
                me a good feel for debugging training runs and understanding where the model struggles.

                This project started from a simple question: “What happens if I combine a detector and a modern
                segmentation model?” I trained YOLO on a small custom dataset and then used its bounding boxes as input
                to SAM to generate segmentation masks. A surprising amount of time went into fixing annotation issues
                and checking label quality. Once things were stable, I compared how different YOLO variants performed
                and watched how SAM handled off-center, low-light, or partially cropped objects. It wasn’t meant to be
                a polished product — just a way to build intuition around modern vision models.

                I built a small visual search system where a user can upload an image and get back similar images from a
                dataset. Instead of predicting labels, the system uses pre-trained encoders (similar to CLIP) to turn
                each image into an embedding and stores them in a vector database. I tried out different similarity
                metrics, like cosine similarity, to see how they changed the results. I also created a simple UI to
                visualize the top matches. The system isn’t perfect — sometimes the “similar” images feel a bit off —
                but that’s exactly what helped me understand how visual embeddings behave.

                This project was my first attempt at building a simple RAG pipeline. I took a small collection of PDFs
                and text files, split them into chunks, and generated embeddings with a sentence transformer. The
                embeddings went into a vector database, and on each user query I retrieved the top relevant chunks and
                passed them along with the question to an LLM. Most of the learning came from trial-and-error with chunk
                size, prompt structure, and handling cases where the retrieved text wasn’t actually helpful. It’s a
                small system, but it helped me understand how retrieval and generation fit together.

                I wanted one project where I touched almost every part of the ML lifecycle on a tabular problem, from
                data loading to a simple deployed service. I started with a structured dataset, built a small pipeline
                for preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categories, scaling features), and then trained a
                few baseline models like logistic regression and gradient boosting. I tracked experiments with MLflow,
                logged metrics and parameters, and compared runs instead of just relying on memory. At the end, I
                wrapped the best model in a small API and containerized it with Docker. The project isn’t flashy, but it
                helped me understand the boring but important parts of shipping a model end-to-end.

                In this project, I treated a public dataset like a small “data science case study.” I explored how users
                interacted with a product over time, looking at basic things like retention, activity patterns, and the
                difference between engaged and non-engaged users. I used Pandas for feature engineering and built simple
                models (logistic regression and tree-based methods) to see whether I could predict a target such as
                churn or conversion. The focus was less on squeezing every last percent of accuracy and more on asking
                reasonable questions, visualizing patterns, and making sure the conclusions actually matched what the
                data was saying.

                format, and stored it so that downstream tasks (like dashboards or training scripts) could use it. I
                used Python and Spark for transformations, SQL for sanity checks, and a basic Airflow DAG to schedule
                the pipeline. The result was a small but real example of how much effort goes into getting reliable data
                in place before any modeling happens.

                and slicing the data into different groups to see how behaviour changed. I created a bunch of simple
                plots instead of fancy dashboards and wrote down observations as I went. There was no “big model” at
                the end — just a clearer understanding of what the data could and couldn’t tell me, which is something

              I don’t really chase perfect projects — I chase the ones that make me stop and think,
              <strong>“Wait… what actually happens if I try this?”</strong> Most of my ideas start as small experiments,
              turn into messy notebooks, and eventually grow into something that teaches me something real.

              <li>I like projects that make me debug my assumptions, not just my code.</li>
              <li>If something confuses me, that usually means it’s worth building.</li>
              <li>I learn more from weird failure cases than from neat accuracy charts.</li>

              Some of my projects live in private repos for now while I clean them up, but I’m always happy to walk
              through them if you reach out. My process isn’t fancy — it’s curiosity, small steps, and paying attention
              to what breaks. And honestly, that’s the part I enjoy the most.
